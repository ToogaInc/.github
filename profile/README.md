# ToogaInc
Welcome to our organization! We're just several (volunteer) developers that develop stuff for Realm of the Mad God raiding Discord servers. Some servers that we power are
- [Dungeoneer](https://discord.gg/o3).
- [Fungal and Crystal Cavern](https://discord.gg/fungal).


## Active Projects

| Project Name | Description |

| RealmEyeSharper | A RealmEye scraper designed to get data in an easy-to-use format and easily accessed by other programs via a web API. |
